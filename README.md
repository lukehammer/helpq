A mobile queue application for businesses to support customers.

###Date
Start Date: March 31, 2015

###Description
It's difficult for customers to find help when they need it while shopping.  helpQ makes it easier for customers to ask for help on their terms while shopping at a store.  The customer simply opens the application on their iDevice, touches the help button, and an employee is notified on their application that someone has enetered the queue.  Customers have the ability to provide feedback for the employee who helped them, which businesses can then use to adapt policies to meet the customers needs.
